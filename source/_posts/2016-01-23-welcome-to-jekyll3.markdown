We are moving the Tokopedia tech blog to jekyll and github. It was previously hosted on Wordpress, but we guess this is a much better fit. Hopefully, you will see more regular posts as well.

Got any suggestions on what we should blog about? File all bugs/feature requests at [the source repo][source-gh].

{% highlight go %}
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world from tokopedia")
}
{% endhighlight %}
